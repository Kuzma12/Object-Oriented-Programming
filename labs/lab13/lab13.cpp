/*Write a C++ function, smallestIndex, that takes as parameters an int array and its size and returns the 
index of the first occurrence of the smallest element in the array. 
To test your function, write a main that prompts a user for a list of 15 integers 
and outputs the index and value of the first occurrence of the smallest value.*/
