/*Assume the definition of Exercise 2, which defines the struct computerType. 
Write a program that declares a variable of type computerType, prompts the user to input data about a computer, and outputs the computerâ€™s data.

Example input and output is shown below:

Enter the name of the manufacturer: McPC                             
Enter the model of the computer: 1000                                
Enter processor type: Intel GFX                                      
Enter the size of RAM (in GB): 8                                     
Enter the size of hard drive (in GB): 1000                           
Enter the year the computer was built: 2016                          
Enter the price: 1200                                                

Manufacturer: McPC                                                   
Model: 1000                                                          
Processor: Intel GFX                                                 
Ram: 8                                                               
Hard Drive Size: 1000                                                
Year Built: 2016                                                     
Price: $1200.00 
Instructions from Exercise 2 have been posted below for your convenience.

Exercise 2
Define a struct computerType to store the following data about a computer: Manufacturer (string), model type (string), 
processor type (string), ram (int) in GB, hard drive size (int) in GB, year when the computer was built (int), and the price (double).*/
